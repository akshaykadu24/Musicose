#  Musicose 

Musicose is an Audio Product company that sells Audio products on website like Earbuds, Speaker, Earphone, Bluetooth Headphone.
And we made a partnership with the Smartwatch brand so watches are also present on our website.

### Credentials to access Smartwatch admin panel
Email: tony@gmail.com 

Password: tony

tony can see only watches in his admin panel and he can edit and delete the product from the website or database, 
he has no access to changes in audio products of musicose,

But musicose owner has access to edit and delete audio products as well as watch products from the database, 
because he is the owner of the website, he can make changes anytime on any products

The admin option will be visible only to the admin user, for normal users admin option will not be visible, so the user can not visit the admin panel or admin side

Admin can also use a website like normal user uses he can also put o order from the website
